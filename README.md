# doom-clone

## Overview

I try to clone doom from the ground up. Not particularly following how DOOM itself was programmed, just trying to make something that mimics it

## Needed features

* 3D rendering engine.
* 3D camera workings.
* Player controls.
* Rendering of textures.
* Rendering of 2D objects in a 3D space.
* File system for storing map data.

## Wanted features

* Some sort of scripting language (Pretty much just making this into a fully-fledged game engine at this point)
* 3D models for enemies (Very basic, like PS1 level graphics) and also for things like the health packs to add more atmosphere (This could also be used to add more 3D objects into the scenery E.X: Pipes on the walls, volumetric walls, etc)
* More depth in maps, one version of the original map but along with a version that can have things like rooms on top of rooms
* Map editor
* Model editor (if 3D models are implemented)
* Ability to use not only a custom file system but also read the .wad files of the OG DOOMs

## Journal

*10:28PM 6/22/2023 (June 22nd 2023):* Development begins.

*10:39PM 6/22/2023 (June 22nd 2023):* A basic framework of different files is created, pretty much just everything I thought is necessary to start on. First commit starts now.
